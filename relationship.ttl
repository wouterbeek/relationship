  a vo:SchemaExample;
  rdfs:comment """<p>

      The relationship vocabulary can be used to describe relationships with the people linked from a web page. This is particularly useful for blogrolls or contact lists but can be used with any type of link. The HTML <code>a</code> element provides two attributes, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel">rel and rev</a>, that can be used to specify the relationship. Both <code>rel</code> and <code>rev</code> take a space separated list of keywords as their value. To use a term from the relationship vocabulary just drop the <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> namespace to leave the property name, e.g. <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/worksWith</code> would become <code>worksWith</code> which can be added as the value of <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code>.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <code>rel</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <code>rel</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linked</em> page has with the author of the <em>linking</em> page.
          For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="elem">&lt;a</span><span class="attr">href</span>="<span class="attrVal">http://example.com/boats</span>" <span class="attr highlight">rel</span>="<span class="attrVal">childOf</span>"<span class="elem">&gt;</span><span class="text">The boat we restored</span><span class="elem">"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>
        <p>This link states that the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code> is a child of the author of the html above. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>rev</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The <code>rev</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linking</em> page has with the author of the   <em>linked</em> page. The example here is:
        </p>
        <pre><code><span class="elem">&lt;a</span><span class="attr">href</span>="<span class="attrVal">http://example.com/boats</span>" <span class="attr highlight">rev</span>="<span class="attrVal">childOf</span>"<span class="elem">&gt;</span><span class="text">The boat we restored</span><span class="elem">"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>
        <p>In this case the meaning of the link is reversed: the author of the html above is a child of the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code>.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The HTML and XHTML recommendations require an HTML document to declare a custom profile if it uses any non-standard <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code> types. This is done by adding a <code>profile</code> attribute with a value of <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> to the document's <code>head</code> element. </p>
    <pre><code>  &lt;head profile="http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
    <h3>Complete Example</h3>
    <pre><code>  &lt;html profile="http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here are the people I know:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://example.com/~freddy" rel="closeFriendOf"&gt;Freddy (he's cool!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://frooble.com/" rel="mentorOf"&gt;Jimbo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mmmm.com/klm" rel="friendOf"&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://example.com/~omah" rel="worksWith"&gt;Omah (does the coding)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://example.com/~jason" rev="closeFriendOf employedBy"&gt;Jason, my henchman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
    <h3>RDF Interpretation</h3>
    <p>Custom parsers that extract RDF from (X)HTML can use the relationships expressed in the links to infer the
  equivilent RDF triples. It should be remembered that the relationship is between the authors of the pages not between
  the pages themselves. Given the following link on a document at <code>http://example.com/mypage.html</code>:
  </p>
    <pre><code><span class="elem">&lt;a</span><span class="attr">href</span>="<span class="attrVal">http://example.com/boats</span>" <span class="attr highlight">rel</span>="<span class="attrVal">childOf</span>"<span class="elem">&gt;</span><span class="text">The boat we restored</span><span class="elem">"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>
    <p>a suggested RDF extraction is:</p>
    <pre><code>  &lt;foaf:Person&gt;
    &lt;foaf:maker rdf:resource="http://example.com/boats"/&gt;
    &lt;rel:childOf&gt;
      &lt;foaf:Person&gt;
        &lt;foaf:maker rdf:resource="http://example.com/mypage.html"/&gt;
      &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
    &lt;/rel:childOf&gt;
